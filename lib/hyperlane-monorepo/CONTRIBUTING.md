We'd love for you to contribue to Hyperlane! Here are the guidelines to follow when contributing:

- [Code of Conduct](#coc)
- [Questions and Problems](#question)
- [Issue Submission Guidelines](#submit)
- [Pull Request Submission Guidelines](#submit-pr)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep Hyperlane open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Please do not open issues for general questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on
[our Discord Server][discord].

## <a name="submit"></a> Issue Submission Guidelines

Please submit a [new issue][github-new-issue] if you have a bug report or feature request.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate issues.

## <a name="submit-pr"></a> Pull Request Submission Guidelines

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions
from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to Hyperlane, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request
for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit
more complex changes, please check up with the core devs first on [our Discord Server][discord]
to ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project and/or get
some early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as well as our review
and merge procedures quick and simple.
