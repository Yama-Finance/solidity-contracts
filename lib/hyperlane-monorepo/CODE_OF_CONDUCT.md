Hyperlane is a decentralized project to enable developers to create shared state blockchain applications.
Our goal is to create an environment where a diverse array of participants come to work together bringing forth their unique experience. In that process it is inevitable that contributors and supporters alike will experience differences in location, language, nationality, professional and overall life experience.
It is only natural that in such an environment of open and diverse participation disagreements and misunderstandings will happen. More often than not these can be easily resolved informally, however there will be edge cases where behavior can cross the line.
Our goal is to create an environment that is welcoming to all contributors, and fosters a robust community built on collaboration and experimentation.
Thus we believe it is necessary to ensure those rare cases that devolve into harassing, intimidating, or otherwise disruptive behavior are mitigated and understood to be unacceptable by the community.

This CoC applies to all members of the Hyperlane Network's community including, but not limited to - developers, participants in meetings both electronically and in person, conferences, or any other project functions. It is important to note that this code is a complement, not a replacement, to legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

**Code**

1. Never harass or bully anyone. Not verbally, not physically, not sexually. Harassment will not be tolerated.
2. Never discrimnate on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
3. Treat your fellow contributors with respect, fairness, and professionalism, especially in situations of high pressure.
4. Seek, offer, and accept objective critism of yours and others work, strive to acknowledge the contributions of others.
5. Be transparent and honest about your qualifications and any potential conflicts of interest. Transparency is a key tenant of the Hyperlane project and we expect it from all contributors.
6. Bring an open and curious mind, the Hyperlane project is designed to enable developers to express their curiousity, experiment, and build things we couldn't have imagined ourselves.
7. Stay on track - Do your best to avoid off-topic discussion and make sure you are posting to the correct channel and repositories. Distractions are costly and it is far too easy for work to go off track.
8. Step down properly - Think of your fellow contributors when you step down from the project. Contributors of open-source projects come and go. It is crucial that when you leave the project or reduce your contribution significantly you do so in a way that minimizes disruption and keeps continuity in mind. Concretely this means telling your fellow contributors you are leaving and taking the proper steps to enable a smooth transition for other contributors to pick up where you left off.
9. Respect the privacy of others, and take extreme care to protect confidential data when you are exposed to it.
10. Promote the rules of this Code and take swift and deliberate action when you see them violated. At all times strive to bring civility and appropriate behavior back into the discussion.
